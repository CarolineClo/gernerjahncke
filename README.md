We created a new website, shop and social media strategy for an independent ceramics studio on Bornholm. 
We made a database of products in Wordpress with new product images and made the website fully dynamic. 
The database is no longer active and unfortunately I no longer have access.
However, the javascript files show how the website functioned so the user could shop by category or design.
