            Our work seeks to honour the relation between maker and material by
            making use of what’s beneath our feet. We do this by collecting soil
            materials in various landscapes, representing different geological
            ages and transforming these materials into glass and ceramics.
          </p>
          <q>
            We study soil - not from an scientific point of view, but from an
            aesthetic point of view
          </q>
          <p>
            When processed the materials will have a very diverse expression in
            terms of shades, textures and viscosity - all based on the
            origin,creating one-of-a-kind-items telling the story of specific
            places and areas.

            Bornholm is a Danish Island in the middle of the Baltic Sea. While
            the island over covers 1,3% of the land of Denmark, it is also
            geologically the most copious land surface. the island hosts bedrock
            from the Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and the Cenozoic era.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our research on the earthly materials started years ago, now we call
            Bornholm our home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today the island earns the title ‘World Craft Region’ for its
            quality and abundance of craft studios. Find us at Grønnegade 5 in
            Nexø.

              We use what lies beneath our feet - research what material itself
              implies and transform earthly materials into products of everyday
              life. Our design comes from a tradition rooted in functionalism
              and is combined with the characteristics specific materials; the
              outcome unfolds the richness of our cultural heritage.

            The decorative nuances show a geographical diversity in the natural
            world that surrounds us. The nuances vary, depending on the specific
            minerals the local materials contain and the variations tell a story
            about their origin. The color pallet manifests the richness of
            nature and is produced without unhealthy chemistry.
